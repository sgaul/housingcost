## Poverty indicators

A few indicators related to the cost of housing and affordable housing will be covered here:
* % of owners paying more than a given share of income for housing, typically 30%
* Other measures of housing cost or affordability, often combined with other costs
* Availability of subsidized housing 

## Data and limitations

The standard measure of affordable housing is the percent of homeowners that pay more than 30 percent of income for housing. In some cases, the threshold is different, allowing for identification of very high-cost housing, or the measure includes renters as well as homeowners. The source for this indicator is the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, the annual sample survey. 

Two other measures are used occasionally: measures of housing affordability, from either private firms or state agencies, or measures of the stock of affordable (or subsidized) housing, again typically from state agencies (here, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority). Below are examples for both of these.

Limitations for this indicator are the reliance on ACS data which can have high margins of error for small communities and the exclusion of renters, especially in Hartford where only around 26% of homes are owner-occupied. [The new Department of Housing](http://www.ct.gov/doh/site/default.asp) may mean better housing data will be available in the future for Connecticut. 

## What do we already know?

Below are references for some local, regional and national reports that use indicators of affordable housing, with some details on how the data is used. 

### Local

* [Health Equity Index](http://www.cadh.org/health-equity/health-equity-index.html) includes two housing indicators - owners paying more than 30 percent and the number of subsidized housing units per 1000 residents - as factors in their model. The Hartford health needs assessment discusses data on Hartford, where 'Hartford received the overall lowest housing score' in the state on the index.  
* [Pioneer Valley State of the People](http://pvpc.org/resources/datastats/state-of-people/stateofthepeople2013.pdf) includes the 30 percent of income indicator along with indicators for housing affordability and availability of subsidized housing. Data for these comes from the Census, the Warren Group and the Massachusetts Dept. of Housing and Economic Development. 
* [Sustainable Knowledge Corridor Dashboard](http://www.sustainableknowledgecorridor.org/site/content/how-are-we-doing) includes a section on housing, including the housing cost burden. 
* [Population Results Working Group](http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2998&Q=490946) cites the same '30 percent of income' as an indicator to track. 
* [Opportunities Hartford](http://www.cahs.org/programs-opportunitieshartford.asp) includes the '30 percent of income' indicator within a set of indicators and performance measures. 
* [Data Haven's Community Well-Being Index](http://www.ctdatahaven.org/communityindex) includes the '30 percent of income' indicator within it's index. 

### Other relevant efforts

* [Boston Indicators Project](http://www.bostonindicators.org/) looks at the share of income spent on housing, along with the percent of housing stock that is affordable (via Massachsuetts Department of Housing & Community Development) and a combined housing and transit cost burden (via MassGIS. 
* [What Matters to Metros](http://www.futurefundneo.org/whatmatters) includes the '30 percent of income' indicator along with a general cost-of-living index from Moody's.
